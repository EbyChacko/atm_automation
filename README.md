## Project Goals

The goal of the ATM Automation Project is to design, develop, and implement a comprehensive and efficient automated system for Automated Teller Machines (ATMs). This system aims to enhance the user experience, improve operational efficiency, and ensure the security of financial transactions for both customers and the financial institution.

- __User Goals__

  - Transaction Security: Implement robust security measures to safeguard customer data and financial transactions. This includes encryption, user authentication, and monitoring for any suspicious activity.

  - Cash Management: Optimize cash handling within the ATM, ensuring that it is always adequately stocked and balanced.

  - Transaction History: Maintain a transaction history for customers, allowing them to review their recent transactions and account balances.

  - Financial Insights: Users want to gain insights into their financial habits and patterns. They look for reports, charts, and visualizations that provide a clear overview of their income, expenses, and savings over time. These insights help them make more informed financial decisions.

- __Site Owner Goals__

  - User-Friendly Interface: Develop a user-friendly graphical interface that enables customers to easily conduct a wide range of banking transactions, including cash withdrawals, deposits, balance inquiries, fund transfers, and more.
  - Error Handling: Develop a robust error-handling system to address common transaction errors, ensuring a smooth and error-free user experience.
  - Cost Efficiency: Optimize the operational costs associated with ATM maintenance, security, and cash management.
