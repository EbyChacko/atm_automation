### Testing User Stories

Certainly, here are some user testing stories for the ATM automation project:

1. Account Creation Testing:

- As a new user, I want to test the account creation process.
- I will select the "Create Account" option and provide the required personal information.
- I expect the system to create a new account, generate an account number, and provide me with my chosen PIN.

2. User Login Testing:

- As a user, I want to test the login functionality to ensure that I can access my account with the correct account number and PIN.
- I will enter my account number and PIN and expect successful login.
- If I enter incorrect credentials, I want to confirm that the system provides an appropriate error message and gives me the chance to re-enter the information.

3. Cash Withdrawal Testing:

- As a user, I want to test the cash withdrawal feature to ensure that I can withdraw funds from my account.
- I will enter a valid withdrawal amount (in multiples of 5).
- I expect the transaction to be successful and to receive the cash amount.
- If I enter an invalid amount, I want to confirm that the system handles it correctly with the appropriate error messages.

4. Balance Enquiry Testing:

- As a user, I want to test the balance enquiry feature to check my account balance.
- I will select the balance enquiry option.
- I expect the system to display my current account balance accurately.

5. Transaction History Testing:

- As a user, I want to test the transaction history feature to view my recent transactions.
- I will select the transaction history option.
- I expect the system to display a list of my recent transactions with details like date, type, and amount.

6. Change PIN Testing:

- As a user, I want to test the PIN change feature to update my PIN.
- I will select the change PIN option and provide my new PIN.
- I expect the system to successfully update my PIN and confirm the change.

7. Edit Personal Details Testing:

- As a user, I want to test the edit personal details feature to update my address or mobile number.
- I will select the option to edit personal details, make the necessary changes, and confirm.
- I expect the system to update my details accurately and provide confirmation.

8. Data Validation Testing:

- As a user, I want to test the system's data validation to ensure that it handles incorrect inputs properly.
- I will intentionally provide incorrect data, such as an invalid atm pin or a non-multiple-of-5 withdrawal amount.
- I expect the system to reject these inputs and display appropriate error messages.

These user testing stories cover a range of scenarios to ensure that the ATM automation project is user-friendly, secure, and reliable. They help identify and address issues, validate functionality, and confirm a positive user experience.
